Resolve imports of a python file or module recursively, exclude site packages & builtin modules.

This project is part of [`phy`](https://github.com/phy-precompiler).

## Install

If you intend to use this package as a library within your Python project, install it as follows:

```shell
pip install phy-imports-resolver
```

If you plan to use its command-line interface (CLI) to generate graphic digram, install the `cli` 
optional dependencies:

```shell
pip install phy-imports-resolver[cli]
```

## How to use

Suppose the layout of your python project is:

```shell
my_project/
├── file1.py
├── file2.py
├── pkg1.py
│   ├── file3.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── __init__.py
```

To resolve the imports tree: 

+ Firstly you MUST specify a root directory named `project_dir` to search within; in this case, 
it is `my_project`. If `project_dir` is not explicitly provided, current directory is used.

+ An entry file path is also required as the start point for the resolver to search from. If you want to resolve from 
a package instead a file, use the `__init__.py` file of the package as the entry file.

With the required arguments, call the `resolve(entry_file)` method:

```python
import phy_imports_resolver
mod_imports_node = phy_imports_resolver.resolve(entry_file, project_dir)
```

where `mod_imports_node` is a `ModuleImportsNode` object, which represents a file module or sub package in a hierarchical tree structure of importing relationship. See the definition of `ModuleImportsNode`:

```python
class ModuleImportsNode:
    # instance attributes
    mod: Module
    project_dir: Path
    imports: List['ModuleImportsNode']
    code: Optional[str]
```

where attribute `mod` stands for the file or package itself, and list attribute `imports` holds other modules imported to itself.

Recursively iterate the `imports` attributes of the entry `ModuleImportsNode` object will given the entire importing relationship tree. 

The complete API docs can be found [here](./docs/module.md).

### use the CLI

```shell
Usage: phy-resolve-imports resolve-imports [OPTIONS] FILE

  Resolve imports from entry code file.

  FILE: path to the entry code file.
```

For the CLI, current work directory will be used as the root directory to search within.

These markdown docs are generated by [`pydoc-markdown`](https://pypi.org/project/pydoc-markdown/):

```shell
pydoc-markdown -I src -m phy_imports_resolver --render-toc > module.md

pydoc-markdown -I src -m phy_imports_resolver.resolver --render-toc > resolver.md

pydoc-markdown -I src -m phy_imports_resolver.types --render-toc > types.md
```

## Reminder

This package DOES NOT support `importlib` to dynamically import modules, for the module imported by `importlib` can be
variable and thus can only be determined at runtime; otherwise, if the the module imported by `importlib` is
constant string, the developer can absolutely use import statement (non-top-placed) instead.
